# GJR_hist_climate_data
This is data and code used in the paper 'How well does CMIP6 capture the dynamics of Euro-Atlantic weather regimes, and why?' by Josh Dorrington, Kristian Strommen and Federico Fabiano.


This repo contains:

### Code

Python code and example notebook showing how to compute geopotential jet regimes in ERA20C, and compute regime stability

### Data


*Reanalysis regime composites
*Reanalysis regime time series
*Model regime composites
*Model regime time series
* tuttecose_wcmip5.pkl - A python pickle file containing dictionaries of climate model predictors and regime metrics, used to fit the ridge regression model, and produce the scatter plots.
